- Command for Zenmap to run a service scan against the Metasploitable machine: 

      nmap -sV -O -T4 -A -v ftp-vsftpd-backdoor 192.168.0.10
 
- Bonus command to output results into a new text file named `zenmapscan.txt`:

      nmap -sV -O -T4 -A -v -oN zenmapscan.txt 192.168.0.10

![textfile](IMAGE/txtfile.png)

- Zenmap vulnerability script command: 

      nmap -sV -O -A --script ftp-vsftpd-backdoor 192.168.0.10

- Once you have identified this vulnerability, answer the following questions for your client:
  1. What is the vulnerability:
